# Super Cube Boy 3D
This is the first game I've ever worked on, and I decided to upload it to github only after 3 months of work on it, so the commit history doesn't really show the whole creation process, but it's still better than nothing. 

In short the player is a red cube and the only objective is to dodge obstacles coming at you at increasing speed.

And you can download and play a couple of previous builds of the game from **Releases** tab.
