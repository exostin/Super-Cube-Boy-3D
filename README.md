# Super Cube Boy 3D
Your objective is to dodge obstacles coming at you with increasing speed.
There are four maps and each has a minimalistic (although distinct) style achieved through different post-processing effects and music specifically made to fit different atmospheres.

You can download and play the game from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/exostin/SuperCubeBoy3D/releases) tab on the right.
